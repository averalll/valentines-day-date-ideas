# Valentine's Day Quiz Questions

## Question Design Philosophy

Each question is designed to:
- **Feel emotional and reflective** - Focus on feelings, connection, and what matters to the relationship
- **Avoid transactional language** - No mentions of cost, logistics, or practical constraints
- **Signal multiple dimensions** - Each option subtly indicates:
  - **Vibe intensity**: low-key vs activity-driven vs big-gesture
  - **Location preference**: staying in vs stepping out vs mini getaway
  - **Energy/romance**: relaxing vs playful vs romantic
