# Valentine's Day Letter Templates

## Design Philosophy

**Tone Guidelines:**
- **Warm** - Feels like a genuine message from someone who cares
- **Romantic but not cheesy** - Avoids clichés, feels authentic
- **Natural for Indian audiences** - Uses familiar expressions, relatable scenarios
- **Shareable** - Written as a message the user can send directly to their partner

**Structure:**
- Opening line (personal, warm greeting)
- Body paragraph (describes the evening naturally, weaves in activities)
- Closing line (emotional, heartfelt)
- Non-negotiables (practical but romantic reminders)
- Date stamp (02/14 – Happy Valentine's Day)

## Template 1: Low-Key & Relaxing

**Vibe:** Comfortable, present, no pressure

```
My love,

This Valentine's Day, I want us to slow down and just be together. No fancy plans, no rushing around—just you and me, wrapped in the comfort of our own space.

I'm thinking we'll order in our favorite food (or maybe I'll try cooking something simple), put on something cozy, and spend the evening talking, laughing, and maybe watching something we both love. The best part? We can pause whenever we want, cuddle up, and just exist in the same space without any agenda.

The whole point is to feel completely at ease with each other. No pressure, no expectations—just presence.

I can't wait to spend this evening with you, exactly as we are.

Non-negotiables:
• Get flowers (even one)
• Phone away for 30 minutes
• Be flexible if plans change
• End the night knowing you showed up

02/14 – Happy Valentine's Day
```

**Design Notes:**
- Opening: "My love," - warm, intimate
- Body: Emphasizes simplicity, comfort, no pressure
- Activities woven naturally: "order in our favorite food," "watching something we both love"
- Closing: Affirms acceptance and presence
- Tone: Relaxed, reassuring, intimate

## Template 2: Activity-Driven

**Vibe:** Energetic, collaborative, memory-making

```
Hey you,

This Valentine's Day, I want us to do something together—not just sit and watch, but actually create a memory we'll talk about for days.

I'm thinking we could try something new: maybe a cooking class, or we could go explore that neighborhood we've been meaning to check out, or even just try making something together at home. After that, let's grab food at that place we've been wanting to try, or cook something fun together.

The whole idea is to be active together, to laugh when things go wrong, to high-five when things go right, and to end the day feeling like we accomplished something as a team.

Let's make this a day we remember—together.

## Template 3: Big / Movie-Style Gesture

**Vibe:** Romantic, special, celebration-worthy

```
My love,

This Valentine's Day, I want to make you feel as special as you make me feel every single day. You deserve to be celebrated, and I've been thinking about how to do that.

I've planned something I hope will feel like a mini escape—maybe a reservation at that place you've been wanting to try, or a surprise I think you'll love. There might be a small gift, and definitely some time set aside just for us, somewhere that feels a little bit magical.

The whole evening is designed to remind you how much you mean to me. I want you to feel cherished, appreciated, and completely seen.

You deserve all the love in the world, and I want to show you that today.

## Cultural Considerations for Indian Audiences

**Language Choices:**
- Avoid overly Western expressions that might feel unnatural
- Use "favorite food" instead of specific cuisines (allows personalization)
- "Hey you," works well for casual relationships common in modern Indian dating
- "My love," feels warm without being too formal

**Scenarios:**
- "Order in our favorite food" - relatable, common in urban India
- "Cooking class" or "making something together" - popular date activities
- "That place you've been wanting to try" - acknowledges shared wishlists/common practice
- "Mini escape" - aspirational but achievable

**Tone Balance:**
- Romantic enough to feel special
- Practical enough to be achievable
- Warm enough to feel genuine
- Not overly dramatic or movie-like (avoids feeling fake)

---

## Non-Negotiables Rationale

**"Get flowers (even one)"**
- Accessible, doesn't require expensive bouquets
- Universal romantic gesture
- "Even one" removes pressure/expense concerns

**"Phone away for 30 minutes"**
- Specific time frame feels achievable
- Acknowledges modern reality of phone dependency
- "30 minutes" is reasonable, not overwhelming

**"Be flexible if plans change"**
- Reduces pressure and anxiety
- Acknowledges that things don't always go as planned
- Emphasizes presence over perfection

**"End the night knowing you showed up"**
- Emotional, not logistical
- Focuses on intention and effort
- Reassuring - success is about showing up, not perfection

## Implementation Notes

**Dynamic Content Opportunities:**
- Partner's name could be inserted after opening ("My love, [Name],")
- Specific restaurant/activity names could replace placeholders
- Custom gift mentions could be added to big-gesture template

**Formatting:**
- Letters are structured as objects for easy rendering
- Non-negotiables are separate for flexible UI placement
- Date stamp is consistent across all templates

**Extensibility:**
- Templates can be modified without changing structure
- New sections could be added (e.g., "P.S." notes)
- Multiple closing options could be randomized for variety
